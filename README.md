# zig-bf

Brainfuck interpreter in Zig. Example: mandelbrot.b

```
$ jenga build
$ time ,jenga/main
```

Baseline time: 20.35s

Final #steps:10712557522

Plan: Explore use of `comptime` for partial evaluation.
Failed. Or perhaps zig has failed me.

Instead: pre-calculate the jump table. Time reduces to 8.5s.

But not close to the 0.5s I get from the c-code generated by partial-evaluation.
